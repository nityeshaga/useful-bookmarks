# useful-bookmarks

##### **This repo is aimed at helping students and enthusiasts on various topics by providing links to some uncommon webpages that were helpful to the the contributers (helpful enough that they stored them in their personal bookmarks folder)**

It is firmly believed that the true and the most rewarding way to find out about any topic mentioned here is by learning the art of googling (if you don't already know it) and doing your own Google search. Find your way around the internet, stumble upon some new helpful page, follow along the links, visit some other pages and discover the wonders of internet. 

So, do all that before looking at our links. It is rewarding. Only after you are done with your own research, should you continue with looking at this repo.

We would also like to see the wonders that you have found. So feel free to contribute. **But make sure that you don't include the very common bookmarks. Remember, we are not trying to create a comprehensive list of bookmarks but a list of personal bookmarks that, probably, no one except you knows about (or atleast that's what you think).**
