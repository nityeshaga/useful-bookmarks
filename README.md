# useful-bookmarks

##### **This repo is aimed at helping students and other enthusiasts on various topics by providing links to some unusual webpages that were helpful to the the contributers (helpful enough that they stored them in their personal bookmarks folder)**

We firmly believe that the true and the most rewarding way to find out about any topic mentioned here is by learning the art of googling (if you don't already know it) and doing your own search. Find your way around the internet, stumble upon some new helpful page, follow along the links, visit some other pages and discover the wonders of internet. 

So, do all that before peeking at our links. Trust us, it is rewarding. Only after you are done with your own research and want to see what we have found, should you continue with this repo.

We would also like to see the wonders that you have found. So feel free to contribute but make sure that you don't include the very common bookmarks, the ones which everybody knows about because that would help only the lazy people who haven't googled even once.
