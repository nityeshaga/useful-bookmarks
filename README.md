# useful-bookmarks

##### **This repo is aimed at helping students and enthusiasts on various topics by providing links to some uncommon webpages that were helpful to the the contributers (helpful enough that they stored them in their personal bookmarks folder)**

It is firmly believed that the true and the most rewarding way to find out about any topic mentioned here is by learning the art of googling (if you don't already know it) and doing your own Google search. Find your way around the internet, stumble upon some new helpful page, follow along the links, visit some other pages and discover the wonders of internet. 

So, do all that. It is rewarding. This repo is not an excuse for not doing that.

We would also like to see the wonders that you have found. So feel free to contribute.

*But make sure that you don't include the very common bookmarks. Remember, we are __not__ trying to create a __comprehensive list__ of bookmarks about some topic, there's plenty of it on the internet. It is a list of personal bookmarks that have helped you in an unexpected way and that are not amongst the first few suggestions when you google for something generic. You know, something that you just happened to stumble upon and might loose if you didn't bookmark it!*

Also star this if you found it helpful! :-)
